Ealing Attack! aka Space Invaders...
A C# project by Simon Bond.
Use how you please...steal code, steal images, steal sound. The important thing is get your own project completed any way you can. There are a lot of good online resources for converting sound files etc so don't get sucked into installing anything to do this.
Have fun!
